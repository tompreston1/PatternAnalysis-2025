## Overview

This project implements a **ConvNeXt-style convolutional neural network from scratch** to perform binary classification of brain MRI scans from the **ADNI dataset**, distinguishing between **Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD)** and **Normal Control (NC)** patients.

The implementation follows the **Task 8 specification**, which requires students to build a ConvNeXt model manually (without using pretrained weights or `torchvision.models.convnext`).  

The model is trained and evaluated on MRI images using modern deep learning optimization techniques to improve stability, speed, and generalization.

## Dataset

The dataset used is a curated subset of the **ADNI (Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative)** collection, consisting of preprocessed 2D MRI slices.

| Split | Samples | Description |
|:------|:---------|:-------------|
| Train | ~21,000 | Used for optimization (85 % of total data) |
| Validation | ~3,200 | Used for model selection (15 %) |
| Test | 9,000 | Unseen evaluation set |
